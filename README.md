# Conference Expense Planner

Conference Expense Planner is a React-based web application that helps users efficiently plan the cost of organizing a conference. It provides an interactive interface to select venue rooms, add-ons (AV equipment), and meal options for attendees, while displaying a live summary of the total cost.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Venue Selection**: Choose from various available halls, including limited-capacity options (e.g., Auditorium with a max of 3).
- 🎛️ **Add-ons**: Select additional items such as projectors, microphones, and speakers.
- 🍽️ **Meal Plans**: Choose meal options for a specified number of attendees.
- 💰 **Live Cost Summary**: Displays dynamic total costs per section and overall.
- ✅ **Responsive UI**: Clean and interactive user experience using React hooks and Redux.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **React** – Frontend UI
