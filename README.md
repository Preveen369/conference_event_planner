# Conference Expense Planner

Conference Expense Planner is a React-based web application that helps users efficiently plan the cost of organizing a conference. It provides an interactive interface to select venue rooms, add-ons (AV equipment), and meal options for attendees, while displaying a live summary of the total cost.
